This is a test file for Friday's file operations tool.

It contains some sample text to demonstrate how Friday can read and display file contents.

The file operations tool can:
- List files in directories
- Open and read text files
- Get file information like size and modification date

This is useful for quickly checking file contents without having to manually open them.

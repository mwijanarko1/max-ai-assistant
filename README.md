# Max AI Assistant - Voice AI Assistant

A complete voice-activated AI assistant that listens, thinks, and responds with natural speech. Built with Whisper for speech recognition, Llama 3 8B for language processing, and Google TTS for speech synthesis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install system dependencies:
```bash
brew install portaudio
```

Then install Python packages:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Max AI Assistant
```bash
python3 run_max.py
```

Or run directly from the source:
```bash
cd src
python3 max_ai_assistant.py
```

Speak naturally and Max will respond with voice! Say "go to sleep" to exit gracefully.

## ✨ Features

- **Context-Aware References** - Understands "it", "that", and "the file" references
- **Session Archiving** - Automatically archives sessions for future reference

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User Speech → Whisper STT → Llama 3 8B LLM → Tool Detection → Tool Execution → Google TTS → Voice Response
                                    ↓
                              Memory Context
```

### Core Components

- **`max_ai_assistant.py`** - Main AI assistant that integrates all modules
- **`stt_module.py`** - Speech-to-text using Whisper Base
- **`llm_module.py`** - Language processing using Llama 3 8B via Ollama
- **`tts_module.py`** - Text-to-speech using Google TTS
- **`tools_module.py`** - File system and utility tools
- **`memory_module.py`** - Conversation memory and context
- **`simple_interrupt.py`** - Keyboard interruption handling

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Listen** - Max continuously listens for your voice
2. **Transcribe** - Whisper converts speech to text in real-time
3. **Process** - Llama 3 8B generates intelligent responses with memory context
4. **Detect Intent** - Two-tier system identifies user intent and extracts entities
5. **Execute Tools** - Can perform file operations, calculations, and system tasks
6. **Speak** - Google TTS converts responses to natural speech
7. **Pause** - Automatically pauses listening while speaking to prevent feedback

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- Make sure your microphone is working
- Check system audio permissions
- Try different audio devices if available

### Performance Issues
- The first run will download the Whisper model (~39MB)
- Subsequent runs will be faster
- Close other audio applications if needed

### Dependencies Issues

```bash
# Update pip and setuptools first
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install system dependencies
brew install portaudio

# Install packages individually if needed
pip3 install openai-whisper
pip3 install sounddevice
pip3 install torch
pip3 install numpy scipy
pip3 install gtts playsound
```
